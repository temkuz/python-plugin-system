# Description

This project is a proof of concept (POC)
for implementing a plugin system in Python.

# Install

Download project

```commandline
git clone git@github.com:temkuz/python-plugin-system.git
```

Change path

```commandline
cd python-plugin-system
```

(Optional): Create venv and use it

Windows:

```commandline
py -m venv .venv
```

```commandline
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Linux / MacOS:

```commandline
python3 -m venv .venv
```

```commandline
source .\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install

```commandline
pip install .
```

# Usage

After installation, run the command

```commandline
poc_plugin -h
```

Output:

```
usage: poc_plugin.exe [-h] {} ...
                                            
positional arguments:                                     
                                            
options:                                    
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
```

The output is empty because no plugins are installed yet.

You can install example plugins by downloading them to
`$HOME/.config/poc_plugin/plugins` from
https://github.com/temkuz/python-example-plugins

After downloading, run the command

```commandline
poc_plugin -h            
```

Output:

```commandline
usage: poc_plugin.exe [-h] {echo} ...

positional arguments:
  {echo}
    echo      echo plugin command

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

Use example plugin:

```commandline
poc_plugin echo "hello world"
```

Output:

```commandline
hello world
```

# Plugin requirements

The plugin must be formatted as a Python module:
- unique name (required)
- have an `__init__.py` file (required)
- have a `load_plugin` function to initialize the plugin (required)
- Define a default function `func` for cli that will be launched via cli (required)

# Possible improvements

Further we will consider possible improvements that were not implemented to simplify the code

- Add support for dependencies of plugins from other python plugins/modules (havenâ€™t tested it, it might work like dependencies of a python module)
- Add a manifest file that will be read before importing the plugin for additional configuration (for example, a different name than the name of the plugin folder)
- Define other functions (required and not) for plugins into which variables for settings will be passed
